            <p style="text-align: left">We have chosen to create an innovative product for students and teachers in Ethiopia. We are based on schools in the country that have access to the internet and a form of computer. <br><br>The teacher is assigned a user on the website and logs in at the start of the class. Students in all classes are already added to a system. The teacher easily addresses the absence in the lessons by checking which students are in the lesson, and by doing this it will be easier to get an overview of who is and is not present. <br><br>There will be a table with the students' names, which day the absence started, how long the student has been away and the reason for the absence. Categories will already be set up for how long the student has been away and which reason(s) the student has been away. <br><br> We do this to make it easy for the teacher to fill in the table, but also so that it will be easy to categorize and get an overview of the absence in the database. The teacher saves the table with a button below and the information is stored in the database on a national basis.</p>

        <h2 class="grid_12">Questions About Us</h2>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>What kind technology is?</h3>
            <p>We want to use the Internet because it is a means that can be easily accessed by teachers with access to it, and it is easy to store and retrieve the data</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>How is the data used?</h3>
            <p>We want to use the Internet because it is a means that can be easily accessed by teachers with access to it, and it is easy to store and retrieve the data</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>What infrastucture available?</h3>
            <p>We are using the internet as an infrastructure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>Who needs to be involved?</h3>
            <p>Students and teachers must be involved in order to retrieve and provide the data. State officials must be involved in processing the data. Parents and friends are also involved in that they often become the source of why the student is away. Doctors and others in the healthcare system will have to document illness on the students when they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>What data to collect?</h3>
            <p>Data on the student's health, both physically and mentally, will be collected. This is because there are both physical and mental reasons for not being able to go to school. Other personal information will be information about family and friends, as well as gender, age and class. There are also problems that can prevent the student from attending school or to categorize more easily in the database.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>How is the data used and visualized?</h3>
            <p>The data is used to categorize and retrieve students who dropout of school. It is used at a national level by creating an overview and at the local level by those responsible for absence or another solution to bring the students back. It is displayed by a table view in the database and in the tables that the teachers have access to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>Are we reaching most marginalized?</h3>
            <p>We meet the most vulnerable by being able to get an overview of those who are struggling a lot mentally or physically and be able to take measures to get them back to school. The most vulnerable are those who have more long-term problems than a case of flu or cold. Students with depression or who have major problems at home are those who will be easier to detect in the system and thus easier to deal with.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_31">
            <h3>Are there any risks?</h3>
            <p>There's absolutely risks. There are risks in obtaining such personal data because of privacy issues with students and other related people. Those who provide information about why the student is not at school, whether it is the student himself or someone else, may not have a desire for the information to be collected. There is a risk in storing the data.</p>
